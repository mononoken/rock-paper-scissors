We want to change the rps game such that the player inputs are from three buttons. The page itself should display the results for each round. The page should could count the wins for the player as well as the computer. When either the player or computer reaches five points. The game should end and declare the overall winner.

After the winner has been declared, the game should prompt the player if they want to play again.

We can remove the game intro alert as it will be displayed on the page itself now.

Consider making getRandomNumber a function declaration.

Consider making a function that sets player score to zero so that it can be called multiple times for reset. Call it at start as well.


playRound should play a round whenever a button is clicked. 

when a round is played and someone wins, their score is incremented.

the game ends when a score is incremented and it equals five after the increment.

add a button the reset the game. a game result puts scores back to five and brings the page back to its original state.
